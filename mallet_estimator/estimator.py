# footprints (inventory rack + aisles absorbed) over the working hours per

# Repair work (R1) — a different UNIT of estimation.
#
# New work prices an ARTICLE from its parts; repair prices an ACTIVITY on
# something that already exists in the client's home. There are no parts to
# nest, the material is small and often not stocked, and the labour IS the
# cost. So repair has its own engine rather than a special case bolted into
# calc_sku — the two never share a code path, only the wage rates.
#
# The three rules the shop actually works by:
#   * a row's minutes are crew x per-unit minutes x QTY (six chairs at 30 min
#     each is 180 min, not 30);
#   * a row that cannot be priced until someone looks at it ("To Inspect")
#     carries its provisional minutes but is kept OUT of the firm total —
#     these are the rows that eat the margin when they hide at qty 0;
#   * a visit has a floor price. Going out at all costs a day; the day rate
#     stops binding once a full day of carpenter AND helper has been worked.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The three kinds of work. New Work builds an article from parts; the other two
# happen at the client's home and share one labour model — what separates them
# is where the MATERIAL comes from. Repair barely buys anything; Supply &
# Install buys a FINISHED article and fits it, which is a different margin
# question because the client can price-check a door and cannot price-check ply.
