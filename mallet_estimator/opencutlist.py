# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Native OpenCutList CSV parser + material aggregator.
#
# OpenCutList's "parts" export (semicolon-delimited) lists every part instance
# with its material, final area, edge-banding and laminate faces — but no
# prices. This module turns that part list into an aggregated material estimate:
#
#   Sheet Goods -> total area per (material, thickness) -> whole sheets
#                  (area x (1+wastage) / sheet area, rounded UP)
#   Hardware    -> count of instances per material
#   Edge banding -> running meters per edge-banding material
#   Laminate    -> face area per laminate material -> whole sheets
#
# Prices are looked up separately from the ERPNext Item rate card; this module
# is framework-free so it can be unit-tested without a bench.

    The actual hardware is the part's own name (HWD_AH_SC_0 = Auto Hinge Soft
    Close 0°), not the coarse Material name (HWD_Hinge) — which can hide
    several distinct SKUs at different rates. Which COLUMN carries that name
    depends on how the OpenCutList export is configured, so every column it
    can land in is tried (parts_list already knew about 'Instance'; reading
    only 'Designation' here is what made hardware fall back to its category).

    Returns one entry per canonical designation:
        {code, category, qty, pieces, rows, grouped, length, width, thickness, named}

    QTY IS THE SUMMED "Quantity" COLUMN, which IS OpenCutList's own Qty — and
    getting here took one wrong turn worth recording, because the wrong answer
    survived a week and looked reasonable throughout.

    Amit, 2026-08-30: "quantity in ocl and quantity in mcft material list are
    mismatched. you are picking total and not quantity." He was right that the
    two disagreed. I concluded the CSV's Quantity column WAS the report's
    "Σ Unit Total" and switched to counting ROWS, which matched his rail
    example (two drawers, two rail sets) and matched nothing else.

    His OpenCutList report of 2026-09-03 settles it against that reading, line
    by line. The report's Hardware table gives, per part, a Qty and a Σ Unit:
    HWD_AH_SC_0 is Qty 5 / Σ Unit 10, HWD_Screw_8x32 is Qty 51 / Σ Unit 51,
    HWD_MiniFix 9 / 9, HWD_ShelfSupport 4 / 4, HWD_DR_SC_550mm 2 / 4. The
    summed Quantity column of the SAME export is 5, 51, 9, 4, 2 — it is Qty
    exactly, every time, including where Qty and Σ Unit differ. The row count
    is 2, 4, 1, 1, 1: neither column, just an artefact of how the export was
    grouped.

    OpenCutList costs hardware the same way — EstimateHardwareRun computes
    `h_price[:val] * cutlist_part.def.count`, price times Qty — so Qty is the
    thing you buy and Σ Unit is the pieces inside it. That is precisely Amit's
    rule of 2026-09-03: "hinge always comes as two parts per packet. drawer
    rails comes as two parts per packet ... in erp i want to store per packet
    price." Qty is packets, the Item price is per packet, and his rail set was
    never evidence for row-counting — a set is one packet and OpenCutList had
    always said 2.

    `rows` is kept for diagnostics only. Nothing prices off it, and `grouped`
    no longer means the numbers are wrong: a grouped export is now read
    correctly, which is what a Quantity column is for.

    `named` is False when the CSV carried no designation at all and the
    category had to stand in — the caller says so out loud rather than
    letting a category masquerade as a real SKU.
